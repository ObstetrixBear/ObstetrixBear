Hi, I'm ObstetrixBear. You may have questions. I am here to give reply.

# :bear: Nomenclature
I work in the field of obstetrics, and my first name is Scandinavian for bear. That's really all there is to it.

# :construction_worker: What I am
I guess I'd be termed a senior developer, for those who care about such metrics. It's about getting the job done. 

# :rage: What I know
I know C, C++, C#, SQL, JS, TypeScript, Assembler, Inform, Python, and various esoteric languages.

# :sweat_drops: What I want to learn
I'm currently looking into Rust. Racket, Golang and Smalltalk also interest me for different reasons.

# :neckbeard: What I do in my spare time
I draw! I draw quite a lot. I code on retrocomputers, mainly the Commodore Amiga, I read a lot of Science Fiction and Fantasy (and occasionally also write). I play table-top rpgs. Mostly, I futz around at home trying to balance all these things with having a family. 

# ðŸ“« How to reach me
Pop me a PM. It'll be fine.
