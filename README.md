Hi, I'm ObstetrixBear. You may have questions. I am here to give reply.

# :bear: Nomenclature
I work at Medexa, a software company in the field of obstetrics. My first name means bear in the Swedish. That's really all there is to it.

# :construction_worker: What I am
I guess I'd be termed a senior developer, for those who care about such metrics. It's about getting the job done. 

# :rage: What I know
I know [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)), [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [TypeScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript), [Assembler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language), [Inform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inform), [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), and various [esoteric programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language). This list is not exhaustive, though; dabbling is fun. 

# :sweat_smile: What I want to learn
I'm currently looking into [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)) and [Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)). [Racket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(programming_language)), [Golang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)), [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/) and [Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk_(programming_language)) also interest me for different reasons. Plus, of course, the need to master [Angular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_(web_framework)). There's a lot to do. 

# :sleeping: What I do in my spare time
I draw! I draw quite a lot. I also code on retrocomputers, mainly the [Commodore Amiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga); I read a lot of Science Fiction and Fantasy (and occasionally also write). I play [tabletop role-playing games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game). Mostly, I futz around at home trying to balance all these things with having a family and life in general. 

# :information_desk_person: What this repository is about
This is my work account. It's here that I test out and develop stuff that I don't want cluttering up the company's official repo, but which I still want to have readily available. Experiments, drafts, stuff like that.

# ðŸ“« How to reach me
Pop me a PM, or reach out to me at [my personal GitHub page](https://github.com/Eleas). It'll be fine.
